== API Documentation ==

= Security =

Make sure you limit access to the enpoints! You should not allow any yahoo off the internet to scan your site and look for these endpoints. I highly recommend some sort of `.htaccess` or nginx configuration settings to deny access to all but the local addresses you use for the API clients. More info on the [github page](http://github.com/remkade/multisite-json-api/).

= Authentication =

All of the endpoints require you to authenticate with an existing wordpress user. Currently all require the superadmin role, but that may change.

Username and password are passed with the HTTP Headers `Username` and `Password` respectively. These are plain text so you need to be using SSL (which you are doing already right?).

= Create Site =
- **URL:** /wp-content/multisite-json-api/endpoints/create-site.php
- **Method:** POST
- **Works with subdomains?:** yes
- **Works with subdirectories?** yes
- **Payload example:** `{"email": "user@example.com", "site_name": "awesomeblog", "title": "Awesome Blog", "password":"123456"}`
- **Description:** Creates a site. If the email address does not exist this will create a new user with that email address. The `site_name` is the path or subdomain you would like to use, password os optional, if not set will fallback to a random generated one.

= List Sites =
- **URL:** /wp-content/multisite-json-api/endpoints/list-sites.php
- **Method:** GET
- **Works with subdomains?:** yes
- **Works with subdirectories?** yes
- **Payload example:** No payload, only GET variables
- **GET Variables:** public, spam, archived, deleted
- **Description:** Lists sites by wordpress tags. All of the variables are boolean 0 or 1, and will list sites where that variable is set to the boolean provided. For example: `?public=1&deleted=0` will list all sites that are public but not deleted.

= Delete Site =
- **URL:** /wp-content/multisite-json-api/endpoints/delete-site.php
- **Method:** DELETE
- **Works with subdomains?:** yes
- **Works with subdirectories?** yes
- **Payload example:** `{"blog_id": 49, "drop": false}`
- **Description:** Deletes a site. If `drop` is set to `true` wordpress will remove the site from the database completely. Otherwise the only thing this does is set the `deleted` attribute on the site to `true`.

== Updates ==

The basic structure of this plugin was cloned from the [WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate](https://github.com/tommcfarlin/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) project.
This plugin supports the [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) plugin, so if you install that, this plugin becomes automatically updateable direct from GitHub. Any submission to WP.org repo will make this redundant.
